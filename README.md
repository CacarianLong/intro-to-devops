# Code Like A Girl: Intro to DevOps!

In this repository are the slides and content for CLG: Intro to DevOps modules. These are derived from the [original DevOps Girls bootcamp](http://github.com/DevOps-Girls/devopsgirls-bootcamp) material.

## Practicals

CLG: Intro to DevOps is composed of three primary modules with additional modules available for those looking to take on a bit more.

1.) [What are EC2 instances?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/1-1-EC2.md)

2.) [What is an ELB?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/2-1-ELB.md)

3.) [How do I automate this with Auto Scaling Groups?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/3-1-ASG.md)

Each of the modules represents a continuing improvement on a blog website - a blog that you can login to, and post things in. With each module, we're making the blog more automated, more resilient, and more durable to issues.

If you run into anything, just give your coaches a shout - we'll be happy to help you.

Good luck!
